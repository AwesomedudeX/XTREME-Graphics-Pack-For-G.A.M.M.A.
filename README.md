# XTREME-Graphics-Pack-For-G.A.M.M.A.

This is the official GitHub Repository for the XTREME Graphics Pack For S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A.

This graphics overhaul is a nice and easy way to make your game look so much better. It features a series of mods to improve visual fidelity, shaders, VFX and textures.

**INSTALLATION:**

To install the pack, just download it using the link below and install it like any other mod in MO2 at the bottom of the modlist. Because of the size of the mod, MO2 may freeze during the installation; just wait for a bit for the mod to be installed and MO2 will be functional again.

Below that, install the optionals and ReShade for this pack in the same way.
